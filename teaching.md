## Teaching

### UTA @ Purdue

I've been a undergraduate teaching assistant at Purdue for 1.5 years. I've been a TA 
for the intro to C Programming class CS159. For this class my main responsibilities include
proctoring a weekly lab section where students work in small lab groups to complete a 
programming assignment. I also would help with holding weekly office hours. I have proctored
4 different lab sections and have been responsible for over 100 students.

Here are some of the kind responses students gave about my teaching assistance.

>Lohith is such a great TA. He is very good at explaining confusing topics. He is friendly and approachable. He is very helpful when it comes to questions, and he always answers emails.

>He did a really great job answering questions and helped the best he can without giving away the answer. He also was very easy to talk to and get help if needed.

>Lohith has been a great help to me. During our lab sessions, I've learned things I couldn't on lectures!

>Mr. Chittineni was quick to help students with any problems they may have had by assessing where they went wrong, as well as what the proper thought process and commands were to get the student back on track without revealing the answer.

>Mr. Chittineni was always prepared for lab and everything runs like clockwork. I almost always know what to expect.
Lohith was very helpful in answering any questions about the lab and our code.

>He is willing to teach us how to reword problems to determine the solution to those problems.

>Lohith was very helpful in answering any questions about the lab and our code.
