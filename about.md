## About me
I'm currently a Junior at Purdue University studying Computer Engineering <br/>
in the School of ECE. My interests are in Computer Vision/Deep Learning and Analytics.<br/>
I've been learning more about how these areas can be used to advance the medical<br/>
/healthcare field. Specifically, I excited to learn more about their application<br/>
in medical image analysis,image/signal processing.<br/>
    While at Purdue I've worked as a Teaching Assistant and <br/>
Research Assistant. In the past, I've interned at a healthcare software company <br/>
called LiveData Inc. as an Analytics Software Intern. This Summer I will be <br/>
working as a Software Engineering Intern at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise.
