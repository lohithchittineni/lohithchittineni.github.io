## About me
I'm currently a Junior at Purdue University studying Computer Engineering
in the School of ECE. My interests are in Computer Vision/Deep Learning and Analytics.
I've been learning more about how these areas can be used to advance the medical
/healthcare field. I'm excited to learn more about their application
in medical image analysis, and image/signal processing.<br/>


While at Purdue I've worked as a Teaching Assistant and
Research Assistant. In the past, I've interned at LiveData Inc. 
as an Analytics Software Intern. This Summer I will be
working as a Software Engineering Intern at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. <br/>
