<p><em>Cambridge, MA</em> | Summer 2019</p>

<p>LiveData inc is a healthcare software company located in Cambridge,MA. I worked in the Analytics Department using primarily Python and SQL.</p>

<p>In the beginning I helped document/flowchart the ETL process for analytics for other team members to review. This would make sure team members were aware of how patient data from the analytics application would be transferred to the Tableau workbooks.</p>

<p>I also worked on Test/Browser Automation scripts for UI testing of Tableau visualizations using the Python selenium library. As a result, QA would be able to efficiently scan through and locate any misalignment or missing information from the visualizations.</p>

<p>Towards the end, I researched predictive analytics methods using SSAS(SQL Server Analysis Services) and constructed different data mining models. I tested and validated each using lift charts, and k-fold cross validation and analyzed whether they could be implemented.</p>
