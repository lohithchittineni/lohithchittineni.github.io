<p>I am currently an ECE UTA for <em>Python for Data Science</em> ECE 20875. This class focuses on intro Python programming and learning more about data science fundamentals. I am responsible for providing support and helping students solve problems and answer questions they have on hw and projects.</p>

<p>I’ve been a TA for the class <em>Programming Application for Engineers</em> CS159, which is an intro to C programming class. For this class my main responsibilities include proctoring a weekly lab section where students work in small lab groups to complete a programming assignment. I also would help with holding weekly office hours. I have proctored 4 different lab sections and have been responsible for over 100 students.</p>

<p>Here are some of the kind responses/evaluations students gave about my teaching assistance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lohith is such a great TA. He is very good at explaining confusing topics. He is friendly and approachable. He is very helpful when it comes to questions, and he always answers emails.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He did a really great job answering questions and helped the best he can without giving away the answer. He also was very easy to talk to and get help if needed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lohith has been a great help to me. During our lab sessions, I’ve learned things I couldn’t on lectures!</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lohith was quick to help students with any problems they may have had by assessing where they went wrong, as well as what the proper thought process and commands were to get the student back on track without revealing the answer.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lohith was very helpful in answering any questions about the lab and our code.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is willing to teach us how to reword problems to determine the solution to those problems.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lohith was always very patient during lab and always helped students to the best of his ability.</p>
