<hr />

<p>I’m currently a Junior at Purdue University studying Computer Engineering
in the School of ECE. My interests current interests extend to Computer Vision,
Cloud Computing, Systems Software, and Analytics. I’ve been learning as much as I can 
from these areas both in and outside of school. I am excited learn more about their 
applications in many different industries, especially in the medical/health sciences field.<br /></p>

<p>While at Purdue I’m currently working as a Teaching Assistant. I am also currently 
working as a Software Engineering Intern at Hewlett-Packard Enterprise. In the past 
I’ve worked as an Analytics Software Intern at LiveData Inc. in Cambridge, MA. <br /></p>
